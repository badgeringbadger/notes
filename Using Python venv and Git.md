# Python venv and Git 

I use Windows so my commands reflect that. If you don't, you'll have to sort them out.

1. setup the environment in the project folder

```
cd %HOMEPATH%\source\projectname
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. add .venv to your .gitignore
3. use it

```
cd %HOMEPATH%\source\projectname
%myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
